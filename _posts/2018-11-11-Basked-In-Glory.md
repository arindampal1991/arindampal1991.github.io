Google India creates a video about Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay, Director of ISI Kolkata. She talks about how she was different from other female acquaintances she had, primarily in terms of attitude and how being committed to one's work can actually bring in all the accomplishments one desires to have.

Yours truly, along with batchmates of MTech CS, 2013 - 15 can be seen at 0:55 in the video. :P
