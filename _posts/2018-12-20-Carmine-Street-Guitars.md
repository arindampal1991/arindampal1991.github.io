You don't really often watch a movie about a great place and get to visit it too.

[Carmine Street Guitars- Home of Kelly Guitars](https://www.facebook.com/CarmineStreetGuitars/) is a place which makes guitar bodies from wood thrown out of really old buildings (either torn down, or just repaired) in NYC. That way, [Rick Kelly](http://www.kellyguitars.com/), who runs the place, says that part of the City lives in the guitars. They are made of 'bones of the city'. Oh my! Who else thinks like that today? This place is run by three people altogether. Rick himself, his mother on accounts, and Rick's apprentice cum designer on the guitars, [Cindy Hulej](https://www.instagram.com/cindyguitars/?hl=en). They have a website as well : [http://www.carminestreetguitars.com](http://www.carminestreetguitars.com)

[Carmine Street Guitars](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7574126/) is a nice movie made on this shop which I watched in [MAMI 2018](http://www.mumbaifilmfestival.com/), and glad I could visit the place as well. Why don't we have movies on [Britannia Restaurant](https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/britannia-company-restaurant-fort/) or [Nahoum's Cakes](https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/nahoum-and-sons-new-market-area)?
