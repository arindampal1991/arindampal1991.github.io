In this complex world where directors 'force' to take down parody-reviews and fish for titles like 'Nolan of Bengal', I look forward to watch 'Jonaki' by Aditya Vikram Sengupta. This film is being screened in Jio MAMI FF 2018, and I'm afraid if I miss it, I might not be able to watch it at all, because till date we lack a medium where budding directors can host their creations easily. Last film by AV Sengupta I watched was Asha Jaoar Majhe which created a lot of expectation. It was his debut film as well. I hope Jonaki lives up to that. Keeping fingers crossed.

For the uninitiated:
1. Asha Jaoar Majhe (Labour of Love) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOIxc6Cy3p8

2. Jonaki is a Bangla word, meaning firefly. It's called Jugnu in Hindi. 
3. Trailer of Jonaki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqPfx7IZ8NU

PS: Could not watch Jonaki because of the sheer mismanagement of MAMI authority. (Maybe they should try to take feedback from attending audience and rectify themselves and not create a ruckus in the name of film festival.)
Nevertheless, will try for the next show. Thanks to Shweta for the photo. 
A total fanboy moment, with Aditya Vikram Sengupta.
