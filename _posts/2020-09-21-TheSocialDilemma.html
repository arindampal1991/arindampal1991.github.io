I&#39;ve tried to put down my understanding in the form of quotes from the show itself.

We are a nation of people who have stopped being friends with people because of who they voted for in the last election. We are a nation of people who have isolated ourselves to only watch channels that tell us that we&#39;re right.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">/*Reason:*/</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;...fake news on Twitter spreads six times faster than true news. What is that world gonna look like when one has a six-times advantage to the other one? You can imagine these things are sort of like... they... they tilt the floor of... of human behavior.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They make some behavior harder and some easier. And you&#39;re always free to walk up the hill, but fewer people do, and so, at scale, at society&#39;s scale, you really are just tilting the floor and changing what billions of people think and do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">/*Effect:*/</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you most worried about?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">[sighs] I think,</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">in the... in the shortest time horizon...civil war.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">/*Is it just another tech?*/</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;roughly, if you say from, like, the 1960s to today, &nbsp;processing power has gone up about a trillion times. &nbsp;Nothing else that we have has improved at anything near that rate. &nbsp;Like, cars are, you know, roughly twice as fast. &nbsp;And almost everything else is negligible. &nbsp;And perhaps most importantly, &nbsp;our human-- our physiology, our brains have evolved not at all. &nbsp;[Tristan] Human beings, at a mind and body and sort of physical level, &nbsp;are not gonna fundamentally change.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">/*Reason deep down:*/</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;There are only two industries that call their customers &#39;users&#39;: illegal drugs and software - Edward Tufte&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&#39;It basically just said, you know, &nbsp;never before in history have 50 designers-- &nbsp;in California-- &nbsp;made decisions that would have an impact on two billion people. &nbsp;Two billion people will have thoughts that they didn&#39;t intend to have &nbsp;because a designer at Google said, &quot;This is how notifications work &nbsp;on that screen that you wake up to in the morning.&quot;&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;A lot of people in Silicon Valley subscribe to some kind of theory &nbsp;that we&#39;re building some global super brain, &nbsp;and all of our users are just interchangeable little neurons, &nbsp;no one of which is important. &nbsp;And it subjugates people into this weird role &nbsp;where you&#39;re just, like, this little computing element &nbsp;that we&#39;re programming through our behavior manipulation &nbsp;for the service of this giant brain, and you don&#39;t matter. &nbsp;You&#39;re not gonna get paid. You&#39;re not gonna get acknowledged. &nbsp;You don&#39;t have self-determination. &nbsp;We&#39;ll sneakily just manipulate you because you&#39;re a computing node, &nbsp;so we need to program you &#39;cause that&#39;s what you do with computing nodes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">/*personally, I think Tech people sometimes live in this superficial bubble that they are superior to others and there is a hidden joke associated with the word - user, as if the user is supposed to be stupid and make stupid mistakes - I am myself guilty of the same.
