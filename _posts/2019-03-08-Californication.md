Californication, Season 1. 

The story, in one word, if I may borrow from The Big Lebowski, 'is ludicrous'. 

A young writer as hot as the Greek God Apollo lives in LA. His girlfriend Karen whom Hank got separated from lives close by, being engaged to another rich man, Bill. They have a 12 years old daughter Becca who lives with Karen and Bill. The writer, as explained in the series, 'is drowned in meaningless pussy'. Which basically means he can fuck any woman he wants to, yet he is not a womanizer, hoard of women come to him just to bed him and he just glides over them as he begs for love to his lost girlfriend, the love of his life. 

The whole production irks of psychological masturbation served in a platter to both young men and women (read teenagers). Men do want to swim into the sea of 'meaningless pussy' and women dream of that prince charming who will be so hot AF that he will drown in the unwanted attention of horny women, yet will be loyal to herself. 

There are other gaps (actually Mariana trenches) in the storyline e.g. Bill never says anything that Hank still loiters aroung his soon to be wife, also how is a 12 years old girl so mature that she practically identies Keats when other people recite them etc. etc. How is a write managing his livelihood in L.A., without any source of income and sipping whiskey the whole day, and drives a Porsche is another question, but we can ignore them for now as we did in case of the prodigal 'Friends'.

And, if the series is so-f'ing-bad, why am I spending my time as well as others' to talk about it?

Well, because I was trying to enlist a set of 10 movies, which is a fun game Sankalan da (who calls himself Collection, the literal English translation of his name, sometimes) invited me to join in, and I thought, why can't TV Series become a part of the sojourn? (Is the word 'series' singular or plural?)
