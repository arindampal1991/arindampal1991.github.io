The third movie I want to talk about, in this movie sojourn of mine, is 'Ora Thake Odhare'. Which literally means 'They live on that side'. The movie is based on a story by Premendra Mitra, and the movie released in 1954. The cast was filled with stalwarts of Bengali cinema, Uttam Kumar, Suchitra Sen, Chhobi Biswas, Bhanu Bandyopadhyay, Tulsi Chakraborti and Molina Devi. The whole setup and making oozes the style of then Bengali cinema; low budget, only few sets, and tremendously good acting. 

The movie is a classic. And the reason I want to drag the reader's attention to this one is This is a hilarious take on painstriking parition Bengali people mourn till date.
