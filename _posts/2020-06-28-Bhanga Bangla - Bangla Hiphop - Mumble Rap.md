title: "Bhanga Bangla - Bangla Hiphop - Mumble Rap"
date: 2020-06-28

Did this moment ever come to you when you have discovered some new music and sort of jumped from the chair to say - "Fuuuuuck! This. is. exactly. what. I. want."? That moment came to me 5 days back when I discovered Bhanga Bangla. 

I was looking for something to listen to while working and very casually searched Spotify. The title '4 AM In Dhaka' gave a vibe that it could be cool. And boy oh boy! It was some experience. 

Let me give you a little context about the band. The band has 3 members, Ivory Shakur, Young Prince and 41X. They all are Bangladeshi - Americans and because they are born and brought up somewhere else other than Bongo, they don't speak Bangla very well. Thus the name of the band. Bhanga mean broken in Bangla. 

They expertise in mumble rap. Following is a quick definition from Wikipedia.

"Mumble rap is a loosely defined microgenre of hip hop that largely spread on the online audio distribution platform SoundCloud in the 2010s. The term implies a mumbling or unclear vocal delivery by artists, and may generally refer to rappers who do not share the genre's typical emphasis on lyricism"

The descrption of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuRSOnrwPQA) gives a brief understanding. Let me put the whole thing below.

"The Evolution Of Mumble Rap.

Mumble rap - the most recent art form of rapping - or arguably the art of not rapping. Rather than rapping clearly, eloquently, articulately and with prowess and esteem, mumble rappers string occasional words together, like “cat”, “sat” and if you’re lucky, “mat”. And mumble rappers tend to do just that, they mumble.

Hip-hop has arguably been the best genre of music in the past two decades. As hip-hop maintains its title, a lot has changed about the genre, such as the lyrics. Hip-hop has two phases, old school and new school each of which give off a different vibe.

Old School “Hip-Hop” has music based prevalently on African American culture. Artists such as Tupac, Biggie Smalls, and Eazy-E often rap about the struggles of growing up in a racialized environment and the work they put in to get where they are today.

In popular songs such as “Changes” by Tupac and “Juicy” by Biggie Smalls, the artists explain how they went from “negative to positive” as Biggie put it.

Old school hip-hop is still popular today and is regarded as “classic” by many hip-hop fans.

“New school” hip-hop has different types of lyrics. Rappers from today’s generation sing typically about girls, money, and cars they have. Some even sing about how they do drgs, drink alchl, and party which sets a bad example for some listeners. Some of these rappers today did not have it as hard as rappers back in the old days. Also Hip-hop artists now are racially diverse, so African American culture is not necessarily found in music today.

People who grew up listening to Tupac, Biggie, Eazy-E, and so on typically do not enjoy hip-hop in today’s era. Songs written when rap was introduced were lyrically better because rappers were able to tell a story using words that rhyme and flow.

Some songs are also more appealing to fans because they can relate to the struggles their favorite rappers faced.

People of this generation are used to listening to new school hip-hop which is the most played genre on the radio. These same fans reject old school Hip-Hop as a part of the music genre. There are even rappers who know nothing about the most influential Hip-Hop artists.

Growing up listening to Eminem has caused me to fall in love with him as an artist. He introduced me to Hip-Hop. But I noticed a change in the music industry. Artists wanted to be part of the mainstream industry and they had to change their music to fit into the mainstream category.

Because of new artists in hip-hop, many lessen known artists are rarely noticed. These artists are said to be “underground.” Underground rappers usually do not make it big because they have music related to the messages embodied by old school hip-hop artists would say.

Some people think old school Hip-Hop is better than new school Hip-Hop. And there are many people who prefer underground Hip-Hop to mainstream Hip-Hop. What do you think?"

Since the lyrics are not that important, the prime focus goes on towards the delivery and music arrangement. But even if the lyrics are not important, passing the message is still important. And they do it really well with only a few key-words. Rap is still poetry and that game is strong with them.

They have received both extreme love and extreme criticism from general people. Extreme love from people who understood / didn't care about the lyrics. Extreme hate from people who didn't like the lyrics and are more concerned about them being linked to Illuminati, Satan worship etc. 

Personally, I think these are a bunch of extremely talented musicians. And the reason for me saying is the diversity in their music. All their songs are very different from each other. They of course, stay in the genre of mumble rap, but do change the story multiple times. They've created the group only for 2.5 years. At least, the first YouTube upload was in Jan, 2018. And in this timespan they've produced 9 songs, out of them I liked 8. Not just liked, I loved them. That's insane for somebody like me who does not have a fixed set of favorite singers. Probably that happens when you understand what you are singing and you just don't sing someone else's writing for money. Ivory Shakur used to go by the name Gamble earlier and used to rap in English. His talent was apparent there as well. That's why it feels like each of the songs are very carefully crafted, and has its own flavor. It doesn't feel like noob music at all, because they're actually not noobs.

The POV which I took while listening to them is that they always say things which they experience. And those take into account the fact all the hardships immigrants have to go through. Remember, that these people who migrated from Bangladesh to USA mostly are not very rich compared to their American neighbors. They are still richer than their countrymen but their children, the next generation of those immigrants don't care about that and are looking for an identity. They also are victims of racism much and thus they speak against that also. 

If you take a random very stressed person and track down his/her thought process you'll understand how they match with Bhanga Bangla's lyrics. A stressed person will sometimes be numb to more stress, sometimes will try to escape. Sometimes s/he will curse an imaginary and vague enemy, sometimes the whole damn society. Those curses will also not have any specific meanings in many cases. They'll just be random badmouthing to the enemy's family members or women in his family.


The following are their songs that I liked, in no particular order, with YouTube links.

1. [Jhamela Nai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQquJmGTAaE)
2. [4 AM in Dhaka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryauRkqFbg4)
3. [Matha ta Fatabo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR0lJ_RjuSk)
4. [Brown like Priyanka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2s06r9pzP4)
5. [Borof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RImj8tiE3LQ)
6. [Natok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQquJmGTAaE)
7. [The Village](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U51yciVvJq4)

I didn't like their latest release, [Rani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3alLp0y3bc). Also, the village is practically an English rap with Bangla words sprinkled on it. 

Listen all their songs in [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3JME2t83KwX07EXNAuVeEK?si=uyqJ8ttTReCJ6fpDd8FsCQ).

Surprisingly, I didn't spot any serious discussion on their creations online. Most of the discussions are either cussing them for keeping a different hairstyle, Illuminati and not understanding the lyrics. Either that, or some reaction videos where some say it's good and some say it's not. Although, IMHO, their lyrics are extremely good, hits all the right spots and there should be a serious critique of these creations rather than just brushing them off as something which you'll listen to only when you are high. 

I thought in this case, I'll go through some of their songs and will try to explain the way I understood them line by line. As of now, I've just penned down the lyrics of the song that I liked most. It's something difficult given it's mumble and their Bangla is actually, in the true sense of the word, 'Bhanga'. So, takes some time to understand what actually they meant and sometimes I have to look up to the English translation to get it.
