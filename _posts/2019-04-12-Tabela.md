Couple of days back, I was discussing about the Hindi word 'तबेला' (Tabela) with friends. The discussion originated from the sheer number of stables for both cows and buffalos in Goregaon area in Mumbai. The congruency of both IT MNCs and cow-stables or domestic animals was the mind-boggling part, which I think, is abundant in any developing country.

To look for how the word तबेला came into picture, I did a quick look up in Google and of course after that, Wiktionary.

Looks like the word originated from Latin word Stabulum, which means (basically, is related to) 'stall' or 'standing', a place for animals (or anyone) to stand. Then it went on to become estabro or estábulo in Portuguese, which later became अस्तबल (astabal) in Hindustani, and later gave birth to the word तबेला (Tabela).

This is very different from the Bangla word গোয়াল (Gowal) which comes from the Sanskrit word গোশালা (Go-shala; Go = Cows, Shala = Place to stay).

Languages are funny.

PS: knowing so much about words is so easy because of (All hail) the Internet.
